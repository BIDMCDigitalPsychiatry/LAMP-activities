# LAMP-activities

Each directory (except `./dist/`) is a different Activity that can be embedded in the LAMP Platform. To compress an HTML or ReactJS project, copy the `./dist/compress_activity.sh` file to the project's folder and execute it. The resulting `dist.html` and `dist.html.b64` should then be renamed and moved to the `./dist/in/` and `./dist/out/` folders, respectively.
